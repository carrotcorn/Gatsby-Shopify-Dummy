  ## Everything needed for the North Shore and more...

      Just because I don't have a brick and mortar location doesn't mean I'm not a local. I have been mountain biking the North Shore mountains for over 20 years and the sport has become too expensive! I am here to provide essential equipment for BC residents because we are a different breed of mountain biker; we destroy almost everything we use way too fast, and stores have been taking advantage of that for years. My goal is to make mountain biking accessible to everyone regardless of income.

      Having worked in a bike shop in the heart of the North Shore, I know first hand that the overwhelming majority of profit made is from bike sales alone. Small items and clothing are an after thought for bike shops. When selling these items that are necessary to ride, but don't pay the bills, only one options comes to mind, egregious prices. Its not fair to spend a fortune on a bike and still have to pay another small fortune for everything needed to ride.

      This store is an experiment. I am here to meet people in the middle. There is always a place for brick and mortar bike shops. Everyone should put their leg over a bike to test ride before they buy and everyone should go to a mechanic because bikes are getting increasingly harder to work on. I am not here to compete with what Bike shops do best, which is selling and repairing bikes. I am here to disrupt the market and sell the items needed to ride at fair prices. Bike shops across the world will attest to how little they make selling stock other than bikes. Our economy is evolving, items are getting cheaper to manufacture, yet the market does not reflect that. **Brick and Mortar stores will be dealerships, and E-Commerce stores like Sea To Sky Cycles will sell the small, yet necessary accessories.**

      I understand the contempt towards big online stores, but this is not one. I am here to solely provide reasonably priced equipment in an overpriced sport, living in an overpriced city. I am a single person running a small business like anyone else and I am focused on selling to the British Columbian market only. What are the benefits of my store? Same day shipping, quality product, and the **LOWEST PRICES IN CANADA, MAYBE THE WORLD!**
